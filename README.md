# Coding Interview Preparation Path
This repository collects coding questions (and answers) to prepare coding interviews. The questions categorised based on topics starting from the most common Data Structures, Recursion, Algorithms and Common Coding Interview Patterns in addition to difficulty, company tags and a source link.

**I've created the project to prepare coding interviews. I'm not an expert in this field (yet), so any contributions and improvements are welcome!**

### Structure 
1. [**Questions**](questions) - includes the *problem statement*, *relevant tags: difficulty, company and source link* (when available) to the most popular coding platforms. You can try to solve it yourself first or/and move to the solution description section
2. [**Methods**](methods) - this section provides one or multiple description of methods to solve the problems. It usually starts with the naive solution and goes into optimized ones. This basically helps to solve the problem before jumping into the solution and improves a **thinking process** (the most important part of coding interviews). Each solution description contains links to solutions in the end.
3. [**Solutions**](solutions) - this section contains the solutions to the problems in Java and Python. These two are probably the most demanded and the most loved languages in the industry, so I try to provide solutions in both of them.
