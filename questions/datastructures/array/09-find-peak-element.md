### Problem statement
<p class="d-tag">medium</p>

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

Additional: You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

Input 1  
nums = [1,2,3,1]  

Output 1  
2

Input 2 (largest)  
nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]  

Output 2  
5  
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6
